Code Refactor

Purpose: To provide a more efficient and accessible webpage for users and search engines.

Problems Solved: This code refactor condensed and reorganized the HTML and CSS codes. The HTML tags are now in semantic order and are more easily accessible in CSS. The images now have alt tags which, again, makes the page more accessible to people with disabilities. I also fixed the links in the header, so they now correspond to their correct information panels on the bottom of the page. 

Lessons Learned: I learned how to format my HTML tags in semantic order. I also learned how to push and pull codes to github.
